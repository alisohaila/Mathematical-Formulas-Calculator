# Mathematical-Formulas-Calculator

Hey there, I was bored and I decided to encode some of the useful formulas in math. You just need to input the values and the program will calculate the answer for you.

FYI, the most challenging formula for me to encode was the Quadratic Formula (took 2 days), and the most easiest one to encode was the Slope formula (1 hour). Note that I seeked help for a part of the Distance formula only, and the rest of the formulas were encoded fully on my own. 

I hope this program is somewhat helpful!
