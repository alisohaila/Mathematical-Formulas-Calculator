# Mathematical-Formulas-Calculator

Hey there, I was bored and I decided to code out some of the useful formulas in math. You just need to input the values and the program will calculate the answer for you.

FYI, the most challenging formula for me to code out was the Quadratic Formula (took 2 days), and the most easiest one to code was the Slope formula (1 hour). Note that I seeked help for a part of the Distance formula only, and the rest of the formulas were coded out fully on my own. 

I hope this program is somewhat helpful!
